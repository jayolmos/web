                    Since I can remember I've been in love with art: cinema, photography, painting.<br> 
                    But also I've been in love with technology and how things work.<br>
                    That's why I was a SysAdmin until 2014 when my other passion came into play.<br><br>
                    From 2013 to 2018 I worked for my own project as a photographer: <b>Pictob</b>.<br> 
                    I went from solo to have a team of 4 photographers, the whole project was based on automation; something better learnt in my engineering work experience.<br>
                    We had clients such as UberEats Spain, Take Eat Easy, Real Madrid (theclubme agency), Pernod Ricard Spain, and several small businesses around Spain.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify col-lg-offset-1">In 2018 I went back in the game as a <b>SRE / DevOps / SysAdmin.</b></p>
                    <p class="text-justify col-lg-offset-1">In 2022 I moved to <b>CyberSecurity</b>: GRC, policies, secOps.</b></p>
                    <p class="text-faded text-justify col-lg-offset-1">
                    One thing I learned from this changes is that creativity, problem solving skills, <br>
                    coworkers and user experience are so important, no matter the business you are in.<br>
                    I came back to tech because I knew the basics of how things work, but most important: I could come back because my friends in tech supported me.<br>
